# Simple Codepen Clone

Codepen is an online code editor used for web development, mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I attempted to create a small clone with the basic/core functionality of Codepen, ie, being able to create web pages/projects with HTML, CSS and JS snippets. The code is autosaved and stored in the browser's local storage, so if you close the tab or hit refresh, it will display the saved code. You can also choose from a variety of editor themes.

I am working on making the UI better, and creating a platform where users can share executable creations/code snippets.
